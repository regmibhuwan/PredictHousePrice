# PredictHousePrice

## Overview
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates a basic implementation of linear regression to predict house prices based on the size of the house (in square feet). The script uses the popular `scikit-learn` library to create and train a linear regression model, and then uses the model to predict the price of a house with a specific size.

## Installation

To run this script, you'll need Python installed on your system along with the `scikit-learn` and `numpy` libraries.

### Steps to Install Required Libraries

1. Ensure that Python and pip (Python package installer) are installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install the required Python libraries using pip. Open your command line interface (CLI) and run the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy scikit-learn
   
## Usage
To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PredictHousePrice.git

2. Navigate to the directory containing the script:

cd PredictHousePrice

3. Run the script using Python:


python predict_houseprice.py

You will see the predicted price of a house with 1100 square feet printed to the console.
